# OIBSIP_BMI-Calculator_Project2
📊 BMI Calculator in Python – from simple command-line use to advanced GUI with history tracking and visualization.
 📖 About the Project
This project is a **Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator** built using Python, developed as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP) – Python Programming**.  
It introduces **beginners** to simple calculations and input handling while providing an **advanced version** with GUI, data storage, and visualization. 
## ✨ Features
 
### 🚀 Advanced Version
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using **Tkinter / PyQt**.  
- Allows multiple users to save their data.  
- Stores historical BMI records.  
- Displays **BMI trends and analysis** with graphs (using `matplotlib`).  
- Provides an intuitive and user-friendly design.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- Libraries:
  - `tkinter` / `PyQt` (for GUI)  
  - `matplotlib` (for graphs)  
  - `pandas` (for data storage & analysis)  
  - `json` / `sqlite3` (for storing user data)

 📝 Steps Performed
   
Created GUI with Tkinter/PyQt.

Added input fields, labels, and result display.

Implemented data storage (JSON/SQLite).

Enabled multiple user support.

Visualized historical BMI data using matplotlib.
